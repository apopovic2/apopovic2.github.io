            <td>5 bits (0-15 characters)</td>
            <td>The stamp is a small symbol printed on bats which shows that it has met the safety requirements for high school and college play. The most popular stamps (BPF 1.15 and BBCOR) are less than 10 letters, so 4 bits is more than enough.</td>

            <td>ASCII</td>
            <td>5 bits (0-31 characters)</td>
            <td>The brand name shows the company that made the bat. The longest name among popular brands is probably "Louisville Slugger," which is 18 characters if you include the space. 5 bits will be plenty to work with.</td>

            <td>Not all of a company's bats are the same. They make different models, which might be made out of a different metal or have some other special feature. Most model names are only a word, so 15 characters should not be a problem.</td>

            <td>The length shows how long a bat is. The longest bats out there are 34-35 inches long. 6 bits definitely covers that.</td>
